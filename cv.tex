%	INTERESTS SECTION

\begin{rSection}{Interests}

  I'm heavily interested in the cross over of code with art and music, and have created or been involved with a number of projects along these lines. I am one half of LiveCodeLab, a duo doing live coded audio visual performances at venues ranging from boat and warehouse parties to the London Science Museum. At the end of 2013 I was involved with an installation in the Puerto Rico Museum of Art, writing the software for a computer controlled, reconstructed piano as part of the Lexus with the Arts program. I also produce music and play guitar, though primarily for my own pleasure.

  Outside of coding and art, I'm a keen rock climber, having now spent a significant amount of time climbing outside around the U.K. My decision to start contracting was mainly down to wanting more flexibility in how I work so I can spend more time falling off cliffs.

  Public speaking is something I enjoy and am always looking for opportunities to do more, whether that be in a technical capacity or otherwise. I've previously presented on subjects ranging from software tool development to language design for live coding environments.
