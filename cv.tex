\begin{rSection}{Interests}

  I'm heavily interested in the cross over of code with art and music, and have created or been involved with a number of projects along these lines. I am one half of LiveCodeLab, a duo doing live coded audio visual performances at venues ranging from boat and warehouse parties to the London Science Museum. At the end of 2013 I was involved with an installation in the Puerto Rico Museum of Art, writing the software for a computer controlled, reconstructed piano as part of the Lexus with the Arts program. I also produce music and play guitar, though primarily for my own pleasure.

  Outside of coding and art, I'm a keen rock climber and juggler, both of which combine my enjoyment of problem solving, whilst letting me get away from the computer screen. Whilst at university I was lucky to become part of a circus troupe, through which I was able to perform at a number of festivals and shows, both in the UK and abroad.
